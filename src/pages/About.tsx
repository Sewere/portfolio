                Hi! I'm Severi Pälikkö, a passionate software developer with a background in Information and Communication Technology. 
                I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in 2023, specializing in software 
                development with a focus on Java, Python, and modern web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in tech started from a deep interest in gaming and problem-solving, and it quickly expanded into a love 
                for coding and building innovative software solutions. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new programming 
                languages, exploring different tech stacks, and contributing to open-source projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges, always striving to find the most efficient 
                and creative solutions. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer.
            </p>
